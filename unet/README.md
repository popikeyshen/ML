1. alleviating the unknown network depth with an efficient
ensemble of U-Nets of varying depths, which partially share
an encoder and co-learn simultaneously using deep supervision; 
2. redesigning skip connections to aggregate features of
varying semantic scales at the decoder sub-networks, leading
to a highly flexible feature fusion scheme; 
3. devising a pruning scheme to accelerate the inference speed of UNet++.
