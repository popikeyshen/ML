Caffe
  Pros and Cons:

    (+) Good for feedforward networks and image processing
    (+) Good for finetuning existing networks
    (+) Train models without writing any code
    (+) Python interface is pretty useful
    (-) Need to write C++ / CUDA for new GPU layers
    (-) Not good for recurrent networks
    (-) Cumbersome for big networks (GoogLeNet, ResNet)
    (-) Not extensible, bit of a hairball
    (-) No commercial support
    (-) Probably dying; slow development
